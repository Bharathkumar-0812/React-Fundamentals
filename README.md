# React-Fundamentals

This repository is a personal, organized collection of notes, examples, and reference material for learning and teaching React — from fundamentals through advanced concepts.

Use this repo to store concise explanations, code snippets, example projects, and best-practice patterns you want to keep handy while building React apps.

## Contents

- **Purpose:** Why this repo exists and how to use it.
- **Structure:** Suggested folder layout for notes and examples.
- **Topics:** High-level list of fundamentals, core and advanced topics covered.
- **Note conventions:** Markdown conventions, snippet format, and tagging.

## Purpose

This repo is meant to be a practical, searchable set of notes you can rely on during development and study. Keep entries short, focused, and accompanied by minimal reproducible examples where helpful.

## Topics (high-level)

- Controlled vs uncontrolled components
- Error boundaries and boundary patterns

Advanced topics:
- Concurrent React, Suspense, and streaming
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and hydration
- React internals: reconciliation and fiber
- Performance tuning and profiling
- Build-time optimizations (code-splitting, lazy, memoization)
- Testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e)
